designscript
============
DesignScript is a novel langauge for exploratory design and a custom virtual machine designed to support the novel features of the language.

The DesignScript project has been folded into the Dynamo project (https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo) under the 'Engine' folder.

This repository is here for historical reference, future send any futher bugs and pull requests to the Dynamo project.

Thank you,
